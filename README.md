ISBN (with a constructor and methods to set and get the ISBN as a string)

Design a class called ISBN to represent an International Standard Book Number, or ISBN for short. The ISBN consists of 10 digits divided into 4 parts. For example, the ISBN 0 941831 39 6 represents the following information: The first part: The first digit "0" signifies the book is from an English-speaking country. The second part: "941831" identifies the publisher. The third part: "39" is the title number for the book. The fourth part: "6" is a check digit to indicate that the sum of the ISBN digits is 10. The class should have a constructor and methods to set and get the ISBN as a string
